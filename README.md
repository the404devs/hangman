*"We made a cool game called Hangman. It's called Hangman."
  -Jatin*
  
It's Hangman, in C#. Well, technically it's "Hangman 2: Classic Comeback"
We had to make some kind of creative twist on Hangman, so we did the most uncreative thing we could think of: a sequel that's exactly the same as the original. Our teacher thought it was funny, so it turned out alright in the end.

Made in colaboration with Kevin and Jatin
